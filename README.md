# RustyGains

I want to build something in Rust and gain experience with TUI applications.
Additionally, I need a simple tool to log my strength training, rock climbing,
and other activities. Therefore, this project is my attempt to combine all of
these elements.

This project is in an unusable state right now! Hopefully this will change in
the near future.
